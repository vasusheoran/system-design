# Banana Programming Language Interpreter

This project is a custom interpreter for the "Banana" programming language, written entirely in Go. It demonstrates the core components involved in building an interpreter from scratch, including a lexer, parser, and evaluator.

## Features

*   **Lexer:** Tokenizes the source code written in the Banana language.
*   **Parser:** Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens generated by the lexer.
*   **Evaluator:** Traverses the AST to execute the code and produce results.

## Technologies Used

*   **Go (Golang)**

## Getting Started
No complex installation is required. As long as you have Go installed on your system, you can run the interpreter directly.

1. Clone the repository (Optional, if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:vasusheoran/system-design.git
    cd system-design/custom-interpreter-go
    ```
2. Run the interpreter:
    ```bash
    go run cmd/main.go
    ```

## Usage
Once you run the command above, you'll enter the Banana REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). You can type expressions and statements directly:

    ```bash
    Hello! This is the Banana programming language!
    Feel free to type in commands. Type `exit` command to exit.
    >> 2 + 2
    4
    >> let x = 5
    >> let y = 6
    >> x + y
    11
    >> exit
    ```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name)`.
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
6. Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure your code adheres to standard Go formatting and practices.
